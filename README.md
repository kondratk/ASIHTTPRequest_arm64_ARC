# ASIHTTPRequest_arm64_ARC
Static library that supports 64 bit CPU and ARC.

This library can be useful if you are forced to update an old project, that uses ASIHTTPRequest library, which is deprecated. Strating from February 2015 Apple force developers to USE ARC and provide arm64 binaries. This library takes it all!
